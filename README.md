# Conditions

This repository contains basic Java programs demonstrating the use of conditional statements and control flow mechanisms.

## 📁 Project Files

Below is the list of Java files and their purposes:

| File Name                | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `ConditionalFlowEx.java` | Demonstrates overall conditional flow logic. |
| `ElseIfHW.java`          | Contains examples using `else if` constructs. |
| `IF.java`                | Basic program using simple `if` condition. |
| `LessThenGreaterThen.java` | Compares two values using `<` and `>`. |
| `NastedIf.java`          | Shows usage of nested `if` conditions. |
| `NegativePositive.java`  | Checks if a number is negative or positive. |
| `SwitchCase.java`        | Demonstrates the use of `switch-case` statements. |

## 🛠 Technologies Used
